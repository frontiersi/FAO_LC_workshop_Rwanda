    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training data** is the most important part of any supervised machine learning workflow. The quality of the training data has a greater impact on the classification than the algorithm used. Large and accurate training data sets are preferable: increasing the training sample size results in increased classification accuracy ([Maxell et al 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2018.1433343)).  A review of training data methods in the context of Earth Observation is available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/6/1034).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many platforms to use for gathering land cover training labels, the best one to use depends on your application. GIS platforms are great for collecting training data as they are highly flexible and mature platforms; [Geo-Wiki](https://www.geo-wiki.org/) and [Collect Earth Online](https://collect.earth/home) are two open-source websites that may also be useful depending on the reference data strategy employed. Alternatively, there are many pre-existing training datasets on the web that may be useful, e.g. [Radiant Earth](https://www.radiant.earth/) manages a growing number of reference datasets for use by anyone. With locations of land cover labels available, we can extract features at these locations from satellite imagery as input for machine learning.  "

    "\n",
    "As timely training data is not always available, in this notebook we demonstrate how to generate a set of randomly distributed training points for a district (Kicukiro) in Rwanda from an existing classification map.\n",

    "The workflow includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preview the district boundaries of Rwanda on a basemap\n",
    "2. Select a district as area of analysis\n",
    "3. Merging classes on the classification map to keep only those you want\n",
