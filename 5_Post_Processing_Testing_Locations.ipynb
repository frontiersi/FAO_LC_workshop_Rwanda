    "## Background\n",
    "In real case studies machine learning may not predict desired classification maps due to factors including limited training data and limited performance of the model for prediction. Therefore, post-processing is widely applied to the predicted classification results, based on assumptions or existing knowlegde of the ground truth. Commonly applied post-processing includes manual editing, filtering, reclassification and class merging, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "In this notebook we will apply post-processing to the land cover maps we produced through the previous notebook. We'll also conduct a median filtering to reduce the 'salt and pepper' effect resulted from pixel-based classification. We will then use external layers that contain reliable information on certain classes and/or have higher-spatial resolution to reclassify classes that may be misclassified by the random forest classifier. These external layers have been prepared and uploaded into 'Data/' folder. This notebook will demonstrate how to do implement these post-processings and visualise the comparison before and after the post-processing. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "1. Load the external layers and land cover maps produced at the testing locations\n",
    "2. Majority filtering of the maps to reduce salt-and-pepper effects\n",
    "3. Apply customised reclassification rules using prepared external layers\n",
    "4. Plot the land cover maps before and after post-processing steps applied\n",
    "5. Save the results to disk as COGs\n",

    "To run this analysis, run all the cells in the notebook, starting with the \"Load packages\" cell."
